            <p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes
                place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take
                place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
                thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is
                compulsory up to a certain age.

                There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large,
                or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some
                governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development
                Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag smalltext"> survey of literature of the research into low-cost private schools
                (LCPS) found that over 5-year period to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving Education for All
                (EFA) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy.[61] The
                polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach
                disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially
                sustainable. The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which
                support LCPSs.[61] Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This
                success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:

                Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private
                schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries,
                between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The
                report findings suggest that girls may be under represented and that LCPS are reaching low-income
                families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.[61]
                Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools.
                While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is
                taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence,
                teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government
                schools. </p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">oseph Chimombo pointed out education's role as a policy instrument,
                capable of instilling social change and economic advancement in developing countries by giving
                communities the opportunity to take control of their destinies.[46] The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
                Development, adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in September 2015, calls for a new
                vision to address the environmental, social and economic concerns facing the world today. The Agenda
                includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 4 on education.[47][48]

                Since 1909, the percentage of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before
                then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the twenty-first century, the majority
                of children in most regions of the world attended some form of school.[49] By 2016, over 91 percent of
                children are enrolled in formal primary schooling.[49] However, a learning crisis has emerged across the
                globe, due to the fact that a large proportion of students enrolled in school are not learning. A World
                Bank study found that "53 percent of children in low- and middle-income countries cannot read and
                understand a simple story by the end of primary school."[50] While schooling has increased rapidly over
                the last few decades, learning has not followed suit.</p>
